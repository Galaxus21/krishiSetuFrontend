# KrishiSetu üåæ - Your Autonomous One Stop Sales Agent

> **A modern, AI-powered web application that provides Indian farmers with an autonomous sales agent to navigate complex agricultural markets.**

KrishiSetu is a modern, AI-powered web application that provides Indian farmers with an **autonomous sales agent** to navigate complex agricultural markets. By automating the entire sales process‚Äîfrom finding buyers to optimizing prices‚ÄîKrishiSetu acts as a digital bridge (*Setu*) that empowers farmers to maximize their profitability with minimal effort.

Designed for India's rich linguistic diversity, the platform features a **multilingual, voice-first interface**, ensuring that every farmer can access its powerful tools in their native language. While the platform also includes a powerful AI assistant for crop advice and disease detection, its core innovation is the proactive, 24/7 agent that works tirelessly on the farmer's behalf.

## ‚ú® Features

The application is built around a powerful, autonomous agent, supported by a suite of AI-driven advisory tools.

### üìà Proactive Sales Agent (Mandi) - Core Feature

This is the heart of KrishiSetu. The autonomous agent is designed to take over the complex and time-consuming task of selling produce, allowing farmers to focus on farming.

  - **Autonomous Opportunity Discovery**: The agent continuously scans B2B marketplaces for relevant buyer requests (RFQs) that match the farmer's specific commodity and quality grade.
  - **Intelligent Price Optimization**: It doesn't just find buyers; it finds the best deal. The agent analyzes real-time market data, buyer ratings, and order urgency to calculate a "smart price" designed to maximize the farmer's profit.
  - **Automated Quote Submission**: Speed is critical in a competitive market. The agent instantly responds to new opportunities by submitting a professionally crafted quote on the farmer's behalf, ensuring they are always first in line.
  - **24/7 Monitoring**: The agent never sleeps. It works around the clock to find opportunities and will immediately alert the farmer via the app when a buyer responds or a deal is secured.

### ü§ñ AI Assistant (Supporting Features)

To support the farmer's core operations, the platform also includes a multi-functional chat interface designed for inclusivity.

  - **General Advice**: Get instant answers to farming-related questions, from weather patterns.
  - **Disease Detector**: Upload an image of a plant and describe the issue in your local dialect to get a quick AI-powered diagnosis and recommended actions.
  - **Financial Advisor**: Get data-driven financial advice. This RAG-based agent uses a knowledge base of financial schemes to provide detailed proposals for goals like securing a tractor loan, tailored to the farmer's specific state.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  - Node.js (version 18.x or higher recommended)
  - npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/krishiSetuFrontend.git
    cd krishiSetuFrontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Environment Variables

To connect the frontend to your backend services, you need to create an environment file.

1.  In the root of your project, create a file named `.env`.

2.  Add your backend API URLs to this file. Vite requires environment variables exposed to the browser to be prefixed with `VITE_`.

    ```env
    VITE_BACKEND_API_KEY="https://krishisetu2-961717481370.asia-south2.run.app"
    VITE_BACKEND_FINANCE_API_KEY="https://krishisetufinadvisor-961717481370.asia-south2.run.app"
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the Vite development server. By default, the application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

```bash
npm start
```
or

```bash
npm run dev
```

> **Note on CORS:** For the local development server to communicate with your backend, ensure the backend's CORS configuration allows your localhost URL (e.g., `"http://localhost:5173"`).

-----

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This application is configured for easy deployment using Firebase Hosting.

### Prerequisites

  - You must have the Firebase CLI installed: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
  - You must be logged in to Firebase: `firebase login`

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Initialize Firebase** (if you haven't already):

    ```bash
    firebase init hosting
    ```

      - When prompted for the public directory, enter `dist`.
      - When asked to configure as a single-page app, answer `Yes`.

2.  **Build the application for production**:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command creates an optimized production build in the `dist` folder.

3.  **Deploy to Firebase Hosting**:

    ```bash
    firebase deploy
    ```

    After deployment, the CLI will provide you with the live URL for your project.
