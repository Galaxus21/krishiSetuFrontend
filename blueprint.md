## Content Accessibility for Farmers

To ensure information is easily accessible for farmers, the website will prioritize a clear and intuitive user interface. This will involve:

- Restructuring the layout to present information in a logical and easy-to-digest manner.
- Using clear headings and visual aids (icons, images) to break up text and highlight key information.
- Potentially incorporating features like language selection and text-to-speech to cater to diverse needs and literacy levels.

## Styling

- Implement a consistent visual theme throughout the application.
- Utilize Aphrodite for component-level styling.
- Ensure responsiveness using media queries or a responsive styling library.

## Development Workflow

2. Create the basic component structure (App, Header, Logo, HeroPage).
3. Develop each component iteratively, focusing on functionality and styling.
4. **Refactor the Header component to include the updated design, navigation with icons, and the search bar.**
5. Implement responsiveness to ensure optimal viewing on various devices.
6. Write unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
7. Deploy the application to a hosting platform.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement state management (e.g., Redux, Context API) for more complex applications.
- Add animations and transitions for a more engaging user experience.
- Integrate a backend for dynamic content and user authentication.
- Implement internationalization (i18n) for multi-language support.
- Add accessibility features to comply with web standards.
